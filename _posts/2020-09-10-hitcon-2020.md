## Prologue

Attending HITCON Community conference has basically been a yearly routine of mine since 2018. Year and year I'm more and more amazed by the quality of the talks and the overall conference - this year was no exception. Every year the organization has surpassed my expectations with their ambitions.

Due to COVID-19, the organization went out of their way to set up remote sessions for both domestic and foreign attendees. While I've heard there were numerous hiccups with the online sessions, I believe it'll get better over time (assuming this is kept a tradition for the coming years). With everything else going on in the world in 2020, I'd like to think we're extraordinarily lucky to be able to have the physical conference running. Since most events are moved to online if not outright canned around the world this year due to the pandemic, the fact that Taiwan was barely impacted is nothing short of a miracle.

To Taiwan and the rest of the world, I do believe this truly is a turning point for everyone involved - not only because of the various hazards going on right now. In terms of information security, I can certainly feel that the government this year is feeling some sort of pressure from the recent infosec incidents that had occurred in the past 3 years. During this year's AIS3 (*Advanced Information Security Summer School*) courses, there was a noticeable presence of National Security and Industrial Control System related courses - which was unprecedented on this scale. In fact, it seems like such a crucial topic that the Vice President of Taiwan even showed up during this year's HITCON opening ceremony.

## Day 1

After the opening, the rising importance of OT (_Operational Technology_, as opposed to IT - _Information Technology_) security was made apparent with the first talk of the day - "Industrial Cybersecurity Landscape in 2020: Trends, Challenges, and Opportunities." Taiwan has been continuously attacked by various APT groups in the past few years, and the OT industry is perhaps the biggest target of all, [as TSMC was attacked by WannaCry in 2018](https://www.2-spyware.com/the-tsmc-appears-to-be-hacked-by-a-version-of-wannacry-ransomware). In fact, the entire semi-conductor industry has been under continuous attack even outside of the OT environment, as evidenced by the [Black Hat 2020 APT Chimera report by CyCraft](https://www.zdnet.com/article/black-hat-hackers-are-now-using-cobalt-strike-and-skeleton-keys-to-target-semiconductor-firms/).
