## Prologue

Attending HITCON Community conference has basically been a yearly routine of mine since 2018. Year and year I'm more and more amazed by the quality of the talks and the overall conference - this year was no exception. Every year the organization has surpassed my expectations with their ambitions.

Due to COVID-19, the organization went out of their way to set up remote sessions for both domestic and foreign attendees. While I've heard there were numerous hiccups with the online sessions, I believe it'll get better over time (assuming this is kept a tradition for the coming years). With everything else going on in the world in 2020, I'd like to think we're extraordinarily lucky to be able to have the physical conference running. Since most events are moved to online if not outright canned around the world this year due to the pandemic, the fact that Taiwan was barely impacted is nothing short of a miracle.

To Taiwan and the rest of the world, I do believe this truly is a turning point for everyone involved - not only because of the various hazards going on right now. In terms of information security, I can certainly feel that the government this year is feeling some sort of pressure from the recent infosec incidents that had occurred in the past 3 years. During this year's AIS3 (*Advanced Information Security Summer School*) courses, there was a noticeable presence of National Security and Industrial Control System related courses - which was unprecedented on this scale. In fact, it seems like such a crucial topic that the Vice President of Taiwan even showed up during this year's HITCON opening ceremony.

### 2020 Industrial Cybersecurity Landscape (ICS & Infosec)

After the opening, the rising importance of OT (_Operational Technology_, as opposed to IT - _Information Technology_) security was made apparent with the first talk of the day - "Industrial Cybersecurity Landscape in 2020: Trends, Challenges, and Opportunities." Various APT groups have been preying on Taiwan in the past few years, and the OT industry is perhaps the biggest target of all, [as TSMC was attacked by WannaCry in 2018](https://www.2-spyware.com/the-tsmc-appears-to-be-hacked-by-a-version-of-wannacry-ransomware). In fact, the entire semiconductor industry has been under continuous attack even outside of the OT environment, as evidenced by the [Black Hat 2020 APT Chimera report by CyCraft](https://www.zdnet.com/article/black-hat-hackers-are-now-using-cobalt-strike-and-skeleton-keys-to-target-semiconductor-firms/).

### Lunch Break (Intermissions!)

I skipped over the next period of talks as I didn't find anything particularly interesting that I wanted to listen to - which was rare. Alas, I went to work on my slides for my Lightning Talk session (I'll get to that later). As always, the included meals and bonuses that came with the conference were amazing to have. This would be a fantastic chance for non-Taiwanese visitors to try out bentos.

Under normal circumstances, I would have preferred to listen to the "APT Chimera - Operation targets Semiconductor Vendors" talk after the lunch break; fortunately, though, I had the chance to listen to the Dr. Bletchley's excellent talk during this year's AIS3 summer school. For those curious, you can find [the slides on Black Hat's website](https://i.blackhat.com/USA-20/Thursday/us-20-Chen-Operation-Chimera-APT-Operation-Targets-Semiconductor-Vendors.pdf), as this talk was also shown off at this year's Black Hat.

Anyways, what I ended up doing was tuning in to the "company recruitment" segment, where sponsors do their sponsored segments and advertise their company in the hope of getting new blood. As mentioned in the prologue, 2020 is a turning point for everyone - the entire infosec industry, Taiwan, every country that suffered from COVID-19, and me.

Why me? Because I've been on the lookout for a job myself as well. Not just any job, but a job that I can find myself enjoying in. Over the past few years, I've decided that the best type of job for me would be becoming a Security Researcher, joining a Red Team of sorts, or doing forensics-related work. In other words, I've been hoping to find companies that offer this type of job opportunity. Several companies did peak my interest, CyCraft, TeamT5, Panasonic Cybersecurity Lab, and several more. Getting a job may not sound like that big of a deal, but for me to get any jobs like that would require me to move to Taipei, the capital of the country. Where I'm from is very different from the bustling life of metropolis, which is why I'm kinda anxious about the future as well. I'll make an updated rambling if I do manage to land a job, though.

### Operation: I Am Tom (AD Infiltration)

The next segment I chose to tune in to was "Operation: I Am Tom," a talk focusing on various attack vectors and methods [TeamT5](https://teamt5.org/en/) had encountered when handling incident responses. Unfortunately, this session was marked as "On-site Only," which means I'm not allowed to show off any of the slides featured in the talk. What I am allowed to do, though, is talk about some of the exciting highlights from the session.

- The hosts mentioned the reason why the section was named "I Am Tom" was because while dealing with one of the incident response cases, the threat actor noticed the presence of SecOp and decided to drop a file called `iamtom.txt` under the root directory.
  - This shows that these threat actors are not only not afraid of these security researchers but would even dare fight back on the spot.
- Threat actors will try whatever possible to run Mimikatz on the victim server
  - Those who had dealt with Windows Server red teaming should need no introduction to Mimikatz. It is an open-source software used to dump NTLM keys. Threat actors love to use Mimikatz in order to move laterally within the victim organization.
  - The researchers noted the use of injection of `mimilib.dll`, a library that Mimikatz uses, into the Security Support Provider. If you are interested, XPN has an excellent article on this subject matter over at [Exploring Mimikatz - Part 2 - SSP](https://blog.xpnsec.com/exploring-mimikatz-part-2/).
- Use of genuine third-party software is not uncommon
  - In one of the cases, the attacker used a software called "Easy File Locker," which was a genuine piece of software used to hide user's files. The threat actor used the software to hide itself from SecOps.
  - While this type of attack method is rather uncommon, as these threat actors would typically embed such functionality in their malware instead of relying on an external program, this example shows that it can still happen.
- Use of old-tricks are still fairly common even when dealing with APTs
  - In this case, the researchers noted that some threat actors had sneakily replaced `sethc.exe` (Accessibility Shortcut Keys) with `cmd.exe`. By replacing the executable, the threat actor can then launch `cmd.exe` by invoking the sticky keys (pressing `Shift` 5 times).
- Use of Telegram API as RAT
  - To create inconspicuous traffic, threat actors may use third-party IM APIs in order to communicate with the C2 station. In this instance, the threat actor chose to use Telegram as their C2 endpoint.
  - The threat actor may use Telegram to send pre-determined commands to victim machines, and the victim machines would return the results in the same Telegram channel.
  - While the use of inconspicuous traffic as C2 stations [is nothing new](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/twitter-based-botnet-command-and-control), this incident still shows that this trick is still actively being used to this day.

Many more topics were presented in this talk, but the above were the ones I found the most interesting.

### Tropic Trooper's USBFerry (APT vs. Air-gapped Environments)

Next up was Trend Micro's talk on the APT group, Tropic Trooper's, attack among air-gapped systems (a detailed report is on Trend Micro's blog - [Tropic Trooper’s USBFerry Targets Air-Gapped Networks](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/20/e/tropic-troopers-back-usbferry-attack-targets-air-gapped-environments.html)).

This is one of the talks that I found the most fascinating. After all, breaking into a both physically-secured and technologically-secured environment is almost impossible - unless you are a very well-trained group of internet assassins, which honestly, sounds like what the APT group is like IRL.

A quick rundown of a physically isolated system is as such,

- Usually disconnected from the public network
  - This means attacking over remote is almost out of the picture.
- Rely on well-protected strategies for data exchange
  - e.g. biometric secured flash drives, using a quarantined machine to scan the device, air-gap switcher, etc.

To fight against this, the APT group used a type of attack they dubbed "Ferry," which, in this case, means "to cross the shore by ship to another." Essentially, the malware would have to travel from devices to devices via removable media (such as USB thumb drives, floppy disks, memory cards, etc.), all while hoping that the malware would not be detected by the AV on the middle-man scanning machine as previously mentioned.

According to the report, the threat actors infiltrated the group via the typical spear-phishing attack, with emails designed for military personnel (e.g., documents with specific weapon information, tanks, etc.). With this information in mind, it becomes apparent that the group behind the attack was most likely state-sponsored, as there's no way your average Joe would have intelligence regarding weapon blue maps and such.

</figure>

Perhaps the most interesting bit was that the researchers noted that the APT group would sometimes “forget” to exclude PDB strings in their malware when dropping new versions into the systems. From there, several intriguing version strings can be extracted from the debug symbol paths. The variant went from having the `PH` initial to `UF`, and when the name change happened, the directory name also included the word `USBFerry`. Going from a no-name project to one with a name means that the project has garnered enough reputation among the group members that they perhaps felt it was necessary to give it a name - and that’s why Trend Micro dubbed the attack “USBFerry.”
This explanation did not sit well with me, though - surely, the APT group wouldn’t be dumb enough to leave the PDB path exposed during the build process, right? To me, this seems more like an intentional move from them to show off, perhaps? Not sure. Either way, I don’t think the PDB symbol paths were left intact just because they “forgot.”
This type of attack is undoubtedly the most gripping to me, though, as the threat actors were obviously highly trained for this level of infiltration.

### A CTF-Style Escape Journey on VMWare Workstation (Guest-to-Host RCE)

This talk was the one I was the most excited about in Day 1. Vulnerabilities that escape from the VM world to the userland are always considered the holy grail for malware. While fewer and fewer of them exist, this talk shows that it is still possible - well, _was_, after the vulnerability was patched. This vulnerability was assigned [CVE-2019-5515](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-5515) and [VMSA-2019-0021](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2019-0021.html), which affects VMWare Workstation 15.5 and other previous 15.x builds. Unfortunately, though, the bug is relatively old, as it was patched some time late last year, so most users are likely invulnerable to this exploit anymore. Either way, it was still very impressive that [Chaitin Technology](https://www.chaitin.cn) was able to find such obscure vulnerability.

<figure class="third">

</figure>

So, where was the exploit found? The vulnerability lies within the virtual e1000e ethernet driver. With a bunch of out-of-bound writes, the threat actor could successfully execute a RCE to the host machine. Unfortunately, a lot of what was featured in the talk was and is outside of my expertise, and the team did not release an official write-up regarding this vulnerability. As much as I'd love to look more into the case, there isn't a whole lot I can base my research off of (and no, I do not have any photos outside of the 3 featured above).
